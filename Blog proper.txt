I have never done a blog before. On some good advice, it was suggested a blog would be a great opportunity for me to share my journey into coding and software development (and maybe a good way to look back and see progression).

In May 2023 I typed my first code - the classic "Hello World!" It was a kickstarter with Code First Girls - Python and Apps. The content was challenging but I found my way through and enjoyed this introduction. In the 8 week period we learnt about the fundementals - syntax, lists, dictionaries, loops, API's (requests + JSON) etc. The final group project employed the use of Pokeapi API to create a little Top-Trumps style program. Really enjoyed implementing what we'd learnt for something fun (and nostalgic!) 
While I was thoroughly enjoying my introduction to python I planned my next steps - javascript. The day after I completed Python and Apps kickstarter I began an Introduction to Javascript, again with CFG. The two languages are similar, some may argue Python is more user-friendly, however, I believe JS is my slight favourite. I mad sure I was attentive (even attempting the course content from a hospital bed after a thymectomy!)
